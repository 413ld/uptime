  introTitle: "**Upptime** is the open-source uptime monitor and status page, powered entirely by GitHub."
  introMessage: This is a sample status page which uses **real-time** data from our [Github repository](https://github.com/koj-co/upptime). No server required â€” just GitHub Actions, Issues, and Pages.
